Note: The projects' backend and database aren't currently being hosted, this will hopefully be fixed in the future.

- **Frontend**: Simple and seamless frontend using NextJS with React TypeScript.
- **Backend**: Created a Spring Boot application to dynamically process and display the scraped data.
- **Database**: Data manipulation within a Postgres database using SQL queries.
